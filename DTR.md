Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):  
Work together before break:  Work at Turing together, stay later in the evenings during the work week.  Front-load this work and work together as much as we can before we leave for break.

Slack communication when we're not together; also let's communicate via phone for faster communication

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
Don't merge your own pull requests.  Fine with one reviewer.  Only use epics if we see a real need for it.
Add a template for pull request.

Post-project:  coffee date
